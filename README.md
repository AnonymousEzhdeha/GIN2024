# GIN2024
This is a, commented version of the Code used for the experiments described in the paper.
Submission for NeurIPS 2024, the Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 


## Code

### double_pendulum image imputation
  Contains simulator for double_pendulum image imputation, see seperate readme
  
### double_pendulum_state_estimation
  Contains simulator for double_pendulum state estimation, see seperate readme
  
### pendulum  image imputation
  Contains simulator for single_pendulum image imputation, see seperate readme
  
### pendulum state estimation
  Contains simulator for single_pendulum state estimation, see seperate readme
  
### Lorenz
  Contains simulator for 
  - "lorenz with known states"(we are aware of the dynamics)
  - "lorenz with known states smoothing" (using smoothing distribution)
  - "lorenz with unknown states"(we lack the dynamics). 
  see seperate readme for each one.

### NCLT data
Contains simulator for 
  - "Known dynamics"(we are aware of the dynamics)
  - "Known dynamics smoothing" (using smoothing distribution)
  - "Unknown Dynamics"(we lack the dynamics). 
 
 see seperate readme for each one.
